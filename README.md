# Cloning

This repo includes the Unity project as a submodule. To clone, do:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/jhancharler/Unity-C-Starter-Folder.git YourProjectName`

If accidentally cloned without including the submodule, just call the following in root folder:

`git submodule update --init --recursive`
